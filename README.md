# Contributions Best Practices

# Commits
-  Write clear meaningful git commit messages
-  Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged.
-  When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix.
-  When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

# Feature Requests and Bug Reports
At the point when you record a component demand or when you are presenting a bug report to the issue tracker, ensure you add steps to replicate it. Particularly if that bug is some peculiar/uncommon one.

# Joining the development
-  Please set up the project on your local computer, run it and fully go through the application before you enter the development. Explore and do self-discovery. (Don't worry ... because of the discovery, nothing can happen to the app or to you. The only thing that will happen is, you'll be more acquainted with what's where and maybe even get some interesting ideas about how to strengthen the app's different aspects.)
- If you want to work on a problem, drop in a comment on the topic. If it is already assigned to another, but there is no evidence of any work being completed, please feel free to drop in a message so that if the previous assignee has dropped it completely, the problem can be assigned to you.
